Create an AWS Lambda Function:

Write a Lambda function that will be triggered when a leave request is submitted. This function will process the request and send an email notification to the approver.

Set up Amazon SES:

Verify your email addresses or domain with SES to send emails.
Create an email template for the leave request notification.

Set up Amazon DynamoDB:

Create a table to store leave requests. The table should contain information about the leave request, such as the requester's email, leave dates, reason, status, etc.

Configure Lambda Function:

Configure your Lambda function to access the DynamoDB table.
When a leave request is submitted, the Lambda function should store the request in the DynamoDB table.

Send Email Notification:

When storing the leave request in DynamoDB, trigger an email notification using SES to the designated approver's email address.
Include relevant information about the leave request in the email body, such as requester's name, leave dates, reason, etc.

Approve/Reject Leave Request:

Provide a mechanism for the approver to approve or reject the leave request directly from the email.
You can achieve this by including approver buttons or links in the email that, when clicked, trigger another Lambda function to update the status of the leave request in DynamoDB.

Notification on Approval/Rejection:

Once the approver approves or rejects the leave request, send a notification to the requester via email using SES.
Include the decision and any additional comments if necessary.

Optional: Monitoring and Logging:

Implement logging and monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch to track the execution of Lambda functions and monitor the system's performance.
